<h1>About Me</h1>
<h6 class="am">
    My journey in computer science began at the University, where I discovered my love for programming.Since then, I've been on a mission to become a full stack developer.
    
    With a strong foundation in HTML,CSS,PHP and javascript, I've had the privilege of completing other projects.This experience has not only honed my technical abilities but has also fueled my commitment to programming.
    
    In my work, I prioritize efficiency, always striving to a very responsive site.I'm dedicated to continuous improvement.
    
    When I'm not immersed in programming,you can find me interesting. I believe that growth is relevant in programming, and it reflects in both my professional and personal life.
    
    Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I'm excited about the possibility of future projects, and I look forward to connecting with you. Feel free to stay in touch.
